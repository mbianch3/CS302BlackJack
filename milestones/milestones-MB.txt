Summary:

This challenge went according to plan. After deciding that Jack and I
were going to be implementing a UI based Blackjack game we decided
that it would be best to use one of the many python game libraries in
which we decided pygame would be our best bet. After this we decided that
I would be in charge of all of the UI based coding while Jack will be in charge
of the more backend game development side of the project. For this project
I was able to start setting up a basic pygame environment which compiles a resizable
screen with a basic background image. This took up most of my time for the project
but went pretty straightforward for a starting implemenation.
