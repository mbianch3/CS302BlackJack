Summary
---------
This challenge was relatively straightforward. I worked on a majority of 
the backend coding for the program with designing the inside of the actual 
game mechanics. My partner Matthew will be working on the UI aspect using 
pygame. We spent a long time thinking up what to do for the project, 
without having something that spends too much time. Overall, we got Dr. 
Emrich's approval in that this idea will not be too daunting, while still 
meeting all requirements. So far, I have used a previous blackjack game I created.
I am working on getting it made in python with minor enhancements to further make 
it easier to read and such. The code I have compiles and runs in c++ with no UI, however, 
it does what we want for the time. I plan on making aces better in-game as well with a decision 
system for the user on whether they want to use an ace as a 1 or 11. Overall, 
we have made a lot of progress, and I think we will finish easily on time.
