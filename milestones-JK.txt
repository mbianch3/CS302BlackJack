Summary
---------
This challenge was relatively straightforward. I worked on a majority of 
the backend coding for the program with designing the inside of the actual 
game mechanics. My partner Matthew will be working on the UI aspect using 
pygame. We spent a long time thinking up what to do for the project, 
without having something that spends too much time. Overall, we got Dr. 
Emrich's approval in that this idea will not be too daunting, while still 
meeting all requirements.
